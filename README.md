PHP snippets to help you be more productive when developing in PHP

## Note
### **This is a major work in progress that...*I've just started.* **

If you have a snippet that you use a lot submit a pull-request!

An issue would also be an easy way to suggest a snippet to be added.

Just add the code that you'd want to be turned in to a snippet and I'll see if I can't get it added.

## Current snippets
| Snippet   | Output             |
|-----------|--------------------|
| `$_`      | `$_COOKIE['...']`  |
| `$_`      | `$_ENV['...']`     |
| `$_`      | `$_FILES['...']`   |
| `$_`      | `$_GET['...']`     |
| `$_`      | `$_POST['...']`    |
| `$_`      | `$_REQUEST['...']` |
| `$_`      | `$_SERVER['...']`  |
| `$_`      | `$_SESSION['...']` |
| `r`       | `return;`          |
| `dd`      | `dd(...)`          |
